# Advanced configuration

Everything here is optional. The `+` button on the bar covers the common cases
without touching a config file — see the [README](../README.md) for the basics
and the settings table.

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4+ (`omarchy-shell`), which provides the bar and the plugin host.
- The built-in `omarchy.menu` plugin, enabled. Only the `+` picker uses it,
  summoning it in select mode through `bin/taskbar-pick`; with it disabled,
  the `+` stops opening but icons still launch, focus, and cycle windows, and
  the right-click menu (the widget's own popup, not `omarchy.menu`) still
  works.
- `jq`, used by `bin/taskbar-pick`. It is already a hard dependency of
  `omarchy` itself, so it is present on any Omarchy system.

No other external tools, services, or network access.

## Where settings live

All of it sits inline on the widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "io.github.thevideinfra.omataskbar",
  "apps": ["Alacritty", "chromium", "code"],
  "iconSize": 17,
  "spacing": 2,
  "runningIndicator": true,
  "dimWhenClosed": true,
  "cycleWindows": true,
  "showAddButton": true,
  "showRunningApps": true,
  "showSeparator": true,
  "attentionFlash": true
}
```

## Running apps that are not pinned

With `showRunningApps` on (the default), any open window no pinned entry claims
gets its own icon after the pinned strip, grouped one icon per application and
removed when its last window closes.

These are derived from what the compositor reports, never from `shell.json`,
and are matched on exactly the app id or window class the window reported —
anchored, unlike the looser word-boundary pattern a hand-written pin gets, so
two unrelated classes can never collapse into one icon. They appear in the
order their apps were opened: an icon is added when its app's first window
shows up, keeps its place for as long as any window stays open, and a
reopened app lands at the end rather than back where it was — because the
compositor reorders its own window list as focus moves, and an icon that
shifts under the pointer is worse than one that stays put. That order is
kept in memory only and resets on a shell restart.

Right-clicking one opens the same context menu as a pinned icon (see the
[README](../README.md#using-it) for its window list, **New instance**, and
close actions); its version offers **Pin to taskbar** instead of unpinning,
which stores the resolved desktop entry id so the pin survives the app
closing.

## Pinned entries

The short form is a desktop entry id, without the `.desktop` suffix:

```json
"apps": ["Alacritty", "org.gnome.Nautilus", "code"]
```

The long form takes overrides:

```json
"apps": [
  "Alacritty",
  { "desktopId": "code", "match": "^Code$", "label": "Editor" },
  { "label": "Scratch VM", "icon": "computer", "exec": "uwsm-app -- virt-manager", "match": "virt-manager" }
]
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `desktopId` | Desktop entry id. Supplies the icon, name, and launch command. |
| `match` | Regex matched case-insensitively against window app id and class. Used **raw** — add your own `^…$` or `\b…\b` if you want anchoring. Defaults to a word-boundary match on the desktop id. |
| `exec` | Launch command override. Takes precedence over `desktopId`. |
| `icon` | Icon name or absolute path override. |
| `label` | Tooltip override. |
| `matchTitle` | Also match the regex against window titles. Off by default — titles produce false positives for browsers. |

## Smart matching

The running indicator only lights up if the plugin can tell which windows
belong to a pinned app. When you pin through the `+`, it works this out for you:

- Apps declaring `StartupWMClass` get that class stored as their match.
- Omarchy web apps get a pattern derived from their URL, because Chromium
  reports them with classes like `chrome-discord.com__channels_@me-Default`.
- Apps whose window class already resembles their desktop id get nothing
  stored, keeping the config clean.

So pinning Google Maps from the `+` just works, without you ever finding out
what a window class is.

## When an icon never lights up

Check what the compositor actually reports, then set `match` accordingly:

```bash
hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | "\(.class)\t\(.title)"'
```

## From the command line

```bash
omarchy-shell io.github.thevideinfra.omataskbar list             # current pins, as JSON
omarchy-shell io.github.thevideinfra.omataskbar pin obsidian     # pin by desktop entry id
omarchy-shell io.github.thevideinfra.omataskbar unpin obsidian   # unpin
omarchy-shell io.github.thevideinfra.omataskbar add              # open the pin picker
```

Handy for keybindings, or for adding a "Pin app to taskbar" entry to
`~/.config/omarchy/extensions/omarchy-menu.jsonc`.
